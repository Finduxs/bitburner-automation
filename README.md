# Bitburner Automation

## Overview
This repository contains the automation scripts I use to play a programming game called "Bitburner". It's related to the Bitburner series I'm making in [my gaming Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVoS73T7gn9h4PHghPxpuw). It contains reference code that you can use in your own scripts. Feel free to modify this or clone this.

For any questions, feel free to flick me an email or leave a comment on my videos. I'm always happy to help :)
