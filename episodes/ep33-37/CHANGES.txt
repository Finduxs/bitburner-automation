New Launch Fleets script (gimme-more-money.js)

- separated pirate into their own components (hack-pirate, weaken-pirate, grow-pirate)
- create flags for specifying home server RAM allocation
- use unix timestamp as PID rather than having a while loop determine it
- ships are now updated on memory reference

  - get list of available servers
  - get list of owned servers
  - get home server RAM

- Prepare servers
  - copy hacking scripts over if they don't exist
  - ensure that we have root access

- Retrieve list of targets
  - maxMoney
  - nodeName
  - revYield

- Retrieve requirements
  - strategy
  - delays
  - maximum threads

- Create attack fleets
  - Retrieve number of threads we'll allocate for each action
  - Group servers into actions

- Launch attack
